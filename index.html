		<h1>HIIIIII! IIII'MMMMM SHAARRRRNNNONNNNN!!</h1>
		<p>A little bit about the stars: I've lived in Albuquerque for many moons. Albuquerque is okay but one thing I like about it is the many places available to do outdoor activities. I love to be outdoors either hiking or walking my dog.</p>
		<p>One of my passions is animal behavior. I love watching my dog learn and interact with her world. I find it fascinating how she is able to communicate with
		humans, dogs, and other animal species, and how she learns to solve problems. I've also just taken up bird watching and love watching how birds interact with each other and the world around them.</p>
		<p>Some of the birds I like include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Tucans</li>
				<li>Blue Jays</li>
				<li>African Greys</li>
				<li>The one outside my window</li>
			</ul>
